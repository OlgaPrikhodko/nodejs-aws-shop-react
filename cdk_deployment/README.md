## ðŸ“Œ Deployment Guide

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Build and Deploy**

Run the following commands to deploy the application:

```sh
npm run build    # Build the app
npm run deploy   # Deploy to AWS
```

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Invalidate CloudFront Cache**

After deploying new changes, CloudFront might still cache the previous version of your website. To ensure updates are immediately visible, run:

```sh
npm run invalidate
```

This command invalidates cached files, forcing CloudFront to serve the latest version from S3.

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Destroy AWS Resources (Cleanup)**

To remove all AWS resources (S3 Bucket, CloudFront, and related infrastructure) when no longer needed, run:

```sh
npm run destroy
```
